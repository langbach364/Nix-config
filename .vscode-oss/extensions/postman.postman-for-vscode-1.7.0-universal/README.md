## Collaborate in Postman

You can collaborate in Postman using the VS Code extension. You can share your collections, environments, and workspaces. You can also assign collection and environment roles to team members.

### Share elements and manage access

You can share collections and environments directly with team members and groups. Team members with Admin access for the workspace or Editor access for the element can manage [collection roles](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#collection-roles) and [environment roles](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#environment-roles) assigned to team members.

When you share a collection or environment that's in a personal workspace, you can choose whether you want to move the element to a team workspace, or convert the personal workspace into a team workspace.

To share an element with a team member or group, do the following:

1. Select a collection or environment you want to share, then select **Share**.
1. Enter the name, email address, or [group name](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/) for the people you want to share the element with.
1. If you have the Editor role for the collection or environment you're sharing, you can give your new collaborators the **Viewer** or **Editor** role on the element. If you have the Viewer role for the element, you can share it, but you won't be able to assign roles.
1. If you're sharing a collection, you can optionally select an environment to be the active environment. This will be the active environment for the team members and groups you want to share with. Select the **Share with Environment** dropdown list and choose the environment.
1. Select **Share**.

> You can also select **Copy Link** to copy the collection or environment's URL to the clipboard, and share the URL with team members.

To manage collection and environment roles assigned to team members, do the following:

1. Select a collection or environment you want to manage roles for, then select **Share**.
1. Select the role next to a team member or group's name, then select a different role. You can also select **Remove** to remove a team member or user group from the element.

### Share workspaces

You can use the VS Code extension to invite team members and groups to collaborate in a workspace.

> When you invite collaborators to a personal workspace, it's automatically converted into a team workspace.

1. Select the invite to workspace icon to the right of the workspace dropdown menu.
1. Enter the name, email address, or group name for the people you want to invite to the workspace.
1. If you're a Workspace Admin, give your new collaborators the **Admin**, **Editor**, or **Viewer** role. Workspace Editors and Workspace Viewers can't assign workspace roles. Learn more about [workspace roles](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles).
1. Select **Send Invite**.

> You can also invite collaborators by selecting **Copy Invite Link** and sharing the link with them directly. Postman will prompt them to either sign in or sign up.

To learn more about sharing workspaces, see [Postman's documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#share-workspaces).

## Document APIs

Postman automatically generates basic documentation for any collection you create, including details about requests and sample code in various client languages.

### Write documentation

Teammates with the Editor role can add descriptions to collections, folders, and requests to make more valuable information available to your users. You can write your descriptions using the [visual editor](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#writing-descriptions-in-the-postman-editor) or you can enter Markdown syntax.

To add a description to a collection or folder, do the following:

1. Select the **Collections** tab, and then select a collection or folder.
1. Enter a description in the **Overview** tab.
1. Select outside of the editor to save your description.

To add a description to a request, do the following:

1. Select the **Collections** tab, and then select a request.
1. Select **View Documentation** in the top right.
1. Enter a description in the right sidebar.
1. Select outside of the editor to save your description.

To learn more about writing documentation, see [Postman's documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/).

### View documentation

You can view complete documentation for your collection that includes a description of each request and details such as the method and URL, the required authorization type, and any headers or parameters. For each request, you can view sample code in various client languages, and example response bodies and headers.

To view the complete documentation for a collection, do the following:

1. Select the **Collections** tab, then select a collection.
1. In the **Overview** tab under the **Description**, select **View complete documentation**. The VS Code extension will open the complete documentation in a new tab.

You can customize the appearance of the documentation by selecting a language to use for sample code.

## Import data

You can import collections and environments that were [exported from Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) and requests from a cURL command. You can also import `.env` files with environment variables from your API project into new environments in Postman.

> Postman no longer supports the collection v1 format. You can [convert your collection's format](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/#convert-postman-collections-from-v1-to-v2) from v1 to v2 to import it using the VS Code extension.

### Import Postman data

To import data, do the following:

1. Select the import icon at the top of the sidebar.
1. Do one of the following:

    * Select **cURL**, then enter your cURL command. The VS Code extension opens the request in a new tab. To import the request, save it to a collection.

        > You can [convert a Postman request to a cURL command](#generate-code-snippets), and import it using the cURL command.

    * Select **File**, then select collection or environment files. If you're importing a single file, the VS Code extension imports it after you select it.
    * Select **Folder**, then select a folder that has collection or environment files.
    * Select **.env files**, then the VS Code extension will detect `.env` files in your API project that haven't been imported into Postman. You'll receive an in-app notification if no new `.env` files are detected. Learn about [importing environment variables into a new environment](#import-environment-variables-stored-in-your-project) in Postman.

1. If you're importing multiple files or a folder, select the checkbox next to the files you want to import, then select **Import**.

> You can also use the `Postman: Import` command from the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) to import data.

### Import environment variables stored in your project

You can bulk import `.env` files with environment variables from your API project into new environments in Postman. Before importing your `.env` files, make sure your project has at least one file with the filename extension `.env` that stores your project's environment variables in key-value pairs. Once your `.env` files are imported into environments in Postman, you can [sync changes](#sync-imported-environment-variables-with-postman) from your `.env` files to their respective environments in Postman.

When you open your API project in Visual Studio Code, you'll be notified by an in-app notification if the VS Code extension detects new `.env` files. Check for new `.env` files from the import icon at the top of the sidebar. You can also import a single `.env` file and its environment variables by selecting the link at the top of the file or right-clicking the file.

To import `.env` files and edit them before importing, do the following:

1. Open your API project in Visual Studio Code. The VS Code extension checks your API project for `.env` files you haven't imported into Postman.
1. In the in-app notification, select **Import Now**. You can also select the import icon at the top of the sidebar, and then select **.env files**.
1. In the **Import Environments** tab, review the detected `.env` files. You can enter text in the **Search by name** box to filter the list of `.env` files by name.
1. (Optional) Select **Edit** next to the `.env` file you'd like to edit before importing into Postman. You can take the following actions:

    * Review the variables that will be imported into Postman.
    * Enter text in the **Filter variables** box to filter the list of variables by name or value.
    * Select the environment name and enter a new name.
    * Clear the checkbox next to variables you want to make unavailable. You can select the checkbox after import to make them available again.
    * Change the [variable type](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#variable-types) for a variable.
    * Persist one or all current values to their initial values, syncing them with Postman's servers after import. To persist all values, select the View more actions icon in the top-right of the environment, then select **Persist all**. To persist one value, hover over a variable, select the View more actions icon, then select **Persist**. Learn more about [initial and current values](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#initial-and-current-values).
    * Reset one or all current values to reflect their initial values. To reset all values, select the View more actions icon in the top-right of the environment, then select **Reset all**. To reset one value, hover over a variable, select the View more actions icon, then select **Reset**.
    * Hover over a variable you don't want to import, then select the delete icon.
    * Select **Reset** to revert all of your changes.
    * When you're done editing, select **Done**.

1. Select the checkbox next to one or more `.env` files you'd like to import into new environments in Postman. Each `.env` file is imported into its own environment in Postman.
1. Select **Import**.

To import a single `.env` file, do the following:

1. Open your API project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Open the `.env` file you'd like to import, and select **Import to Postman** at the top of the file. You can also right-click on the `.env` file, and select **Import / Open in Postman**.

    > You won't have the option to edit the environment variables before importing the `.env` file into Postman. You can edit the environment variables once they're imported, such as changing the variable type.

1. A new Postman environment opens in a new tab with the environment variables imported from your project. Review the imported environment variables.
1. Select **Save** if you make any changes to the environment.

Once environment variables are imported from a single `.env` file, you can select **Open in Postman** at the top of the previously imported file. You can also right-click on the `.env` file and select **Import / Open in Postman**. This opens the environment in a new tab with the environment variables you imported earlier. Note that if the environment is moved to a new workspace in Postman, these options will open the environment in the relevant workspace if you have permission to access.

Learn more about [managing environments](#manage-environments) in the Postman VS Code extension.

### Sync imported environment variables with Postman

You can sync changes made to your imported `.env` files with their respective environments in Postman. Make sure you've [imported the `.env` files into Postman](#import-environment-variables-stored-in-your-project) before syncing them.

> **Important:** When you sync changes to imported `.env` files, both the initial and current values are updated in their respective environments in Postman. The initial value is synced to the Postman cloud, and is shared with your team when you share the environment.

To detect and sync changes in `.env` files, do the following:

1. Open your API project in Visual Studio Code, and edit `.env` files you've already imported into Postman.
1. You can take one of the following actions to sync changes to the `.env` file:

    * Open the `.env` file or its respective environment in Postman. Then select **Sync Now** in the in-app notification.
    * Open the `.env` file, and select **Sync to Postman** at the top of the file.
    * Right-click on the `.env` file, and select **Sync to Postman**.

1. Repeat these steps for each imported `.env` file you've made changes to.

## Generate code snippets

You can convert an API request into a code snippet in the language of your choice. Available languages and frameworks include cURL, Node.js, Python, and more.

To generate a code snippet, open an HTTP request, then select **Code** (below **Send**). Select a [language or framework](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/generate-code-snippets/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) from the dropdown list, then copy the code snippet to your clipboard.

## Use cookies

You can view and edit cookies associated with different domains. You can then use the cookies stored in the cookie jar when sending HTTP requests in Postman.

![Manage cookies](https://st-ar.cdn.postman.com/release-notes/vs-code/overview/request-cookies-2507.gif)

To manage cookies in the VS Code extension, open an HTTP request, then select **Cookies** (below **Send**).

> You can also open the cookie editor with the `Postman: Open cookies editor` command in the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

To learn more about using cookies, see [Postman's documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/).

## Test your API

You can use the VS Code extension to test an API's functionality. You can add test scripts to your collection, folders, and requests. You can also run a collection's or folder's requests in a specific sequence.

### Test your API using scripts

You can add API test scripts to collections, folders, and requests that run after a response is received. Add tests to confirm that your API is working as expected, and help you debug your API if something goes wrong. Postman supports test scripts written in JavaScript.

To add test scripts to collections, folders, and requests, do the following:

1. Select a collection, folder, or request you'd like to add tests to.

    > To learn more about testing collections and folders, see [Postman's documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/#test-collections-and-folders).

1. Select the **Tests** tab, and add your API test scripts. You can add your own test scripts and snippets of commonly-used test code. For test script examples, see [Postman's documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-examples/).
1. Optionally, you can [add log statements to your test scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#using-log-statements) to help you debug your requests. Logged statements display in [the Postman Console](#troubleshoot-with-the-postman-console).
1. Select **Send** to run your request. The tests will run after a response is received. In the **Response** section, select the **Test Results** tab to review the results of your tests.

To learn more about writing tests scripts and using snippets of commonly-used test code, see [Postman's documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/#writing-test-scripts).

### Test your API using the Collection Runner

You can use the Collection Runner to manually run a collection's or folder's requests in a specific sequence, enabling you to test an API's functionality or performance. You can also automate collection runs in your CI/CD with the [Postman CLI](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) or [Newman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).

By default, your requests run in the sequence they're listed in the collection. If you need to change the order of execution, select and drag a request to its new location in the sequence. You can also remove an individual request from the run by clearing the checkbox next to its name. You can optionally use [API test scripts](#test-your-api-using-scripts) to pass data between requests and alter the request workflow. Learn how to [customize a collection run with test scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/running-collections/building-workflows/).

To manually run requests in a collection or folder, do the following:

1. Select a collection or folder with requests you want to run in sequence.
1. Select **Run** to configure the collection run.
1. If you want your collection to run with an environment, select it using the environment selector at the top right. You can also select **Create New** to create a new environment. Learn how to [manage environments in the VS Code extension](#manage-environments).
1. Choose any configuration options:

    * **Iterations** - The number of iterations for your collection run. You can also run collections multiple times with different data sets to [build workflows](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/running-collections/building-workflows/).
    * **Delay** - An interval delay in milliseconds between each request.
    * **Data** - You can import a data file and use its values in the collection run. The data file must be in CSV or JSON format. Learn more about [running collections using imported data](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/running-collections/working-with-data-files/).
    * **Persist responses for a session** - Log the response headers and bodies so you can review them after running the collection. For large collections, persisting responses may affect performance.

        >  Request and response details are persisted locally during your current Postman session and aren't saved permanently. Signing out of Postman, signing into another device with the same account, or refreshing your browser will end your session and remove the logged data.
        >
        > Response and request details are available for the person who started the collection run. Other team members can't view details for collection runs that you start.

    * **Advanced settings**
        * **Stop run if an error occurs** - By default, the collection run stops if an exception is encountered within a script or if there's a problem sending a request. Clear this checkbox if you want the collection run to continue after an error occurs.
        * **Keep variable values** - Persist the variables used in the run, so any variables updated by the run will remain changed after it completes. If you don't persist variables, changes aren't saved after the run completes. _Note that persisting variables in the collection run will update the current value only._
        * **Run collection without using stored cookies** - If your requests use cookies, you can optionally deactivate them for a collection run.
        * **Save cookies after collection run** - Save the cookies used in this session to the cookie manager. Any values changed by requests during the run will remain after it completes.

1. To run the collection with your completed configuration, select **Run (collection name)**.

> Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of collection runs you can use each month. This limit applies to collections you run manually. A collection run with multiple iterations counts as a single run.

When running collections manually, Postman displays the results of your request executions and test results in real time. To learn more about what happened during the collection run, you can:
* Select a request to view more details about it, including the response, headers, and request.
* Select the name of a request to open it in a new tab.
* Select the **Passed**, **Failed**, or **Skipped** tabs to filter the results by test status. To show all requests, select the **All Tests** tab. If any tests in a request script fail during a collection run, the whole request fails.
* Select **View all runs** to view the run history for your collection.
* Select **Run Again** to run the collection again using the same settings.
* Select **+ New Run** to configure a new run for the collection. Make changes to any settings, and then select **Run (collection name)** to run the collection again.

You can also view the run history for your collection, including collections you ran using the Collection Runner and the Postman CLI. Select a collection or folder, then select the **Runs** tab. You can filter your run history by the number of collection runs to view, users who ran the collection, the test status of the collection runs, and the source of the collection run. To return to the results of the collection run, hover over a collection run and select the view report icon.

## Troubleshoot with the Postman Console

You can use the Postman Console to [troubleshoot your requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/). You can also use the Console to debug [pre-request scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/pre-request-scripts/) and [tests scripts](#test-your-api-using-scripts), logging output to the Console. To open the Postman Console, select the console icon at the top of the sidebar.
