## Project Settings

Configure your project by creating or updating a settings.json file at the project's root. If you already have a `.vscode/settings.json` file, skip the first two steps.

1. Open the command palette in VSCode:

   - `CTRL + SHIFT + P` (Windows)
   - `CMD + SHIFT + P` (Mac OS)

2. Type `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)`.

3. In the `.vscode/settings.json` file, copy and paste the following settings:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "jsonFlow.enable": true, // Enable or disable the extension. Example: true, false
     "jsonFlow.files.include": [
         "json",
         "jsonc"
     ], // The file extensions to watch for changes. Example: "json", "jsonc"
     "jsonFlow.files.exclude": [
         "**/node_modules/**",
         "**/dist/**",
         "**/out/**",
         "**/build/**",
         "**/vendor/**"
     ], // The files to exclude from watching. Example: "**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/out/**", "**/build/**", "**/vendor/**"
     "jsonFlow.files.showPath": true, // Show the path of the file in the file name. Example: "home.component.tsx (pages/home)"
     "jsonFlow.graph.showValues": true, // Show the values of the nodes in the graph. Example: "name: 'John Doe'"
     "jsonFlow.graph.nodeWidth": 200, // The width of the nodes in the graph. Example: 200
     "jsonFlow.graph.nodeHeight": 50, // The height of the nodes in the graph. Example: 50
     "jsonFlow.graph.nodeBorderColor": "white", // The border color of the nodes in the graph. Example: "white"
     "jsonFlow.graph.nodeColor": "white", // The color of the nodes in the graph. Example: "white"
     "jsonFlow.graph.edgeColor": "white", // The color of the edges in the graph. Example: "white"
     "jsonFlow.graph.layoutDirection": "TB", // The layout direction of the graph. Example: "TB", "LR"
     "jsonFlow.image.folder": "images", // The folder where the images will be saved. Example: "images"
   }
   ```

4. **Restart VS Code**

Your project is now set up to automatically format code upon saving.

## Code Generation from JSON

Enhance your development workflow by generating code from JSON structures in various programming languages using the [quicktype](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quicktype) library.

### Supported Languages

- TypeScript
- Go
- Rust
- Python
- Java
- C#
- Swift
- Kotlin
- Dart
- C++
- Objective-C
- PHP
- Ruby
- Scala
- Elm
- JSON Schema
- Haskell
- JavaScript
- Flow
- Prop-Types
- Pike

### How to Use

1. **Open a JSON File**: Open the JSON file you wish to convert in Visual Studio Code.

2. **Right-Click on the Editor**:
   - Right-click on the editor to open the context menu.
   - Select the `Convert to Type or Structure` option.

3. **Select the Target Language**: Choose your desired programming language from the provided list.

4. **Provide a Type or Structure Name**: Enter a name for the class, structure, or interface that will represent the JSON data in the selected language.

5. **Review the Generated Code**: The extension will generate the corresponding code and display it in a new editor tab. You can review, copy, or save the code as needed.

### Example

Given the following JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

If you select TypeScript as the target language and name the type Person, the generated code will be:

```typescript
export interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    email: string;
}
```

This interface can be directly utilized in your TypeScript project to ensure proper type checking and IntelliSense support.
